# Portable launcher for Kodi
## Introduction
I was recently doing some research on using [Kodi/XBMC](http://kodi.tv) (hereafter referred to as just Kodi)
as a completely portable media centre, and I found this thread on the Kodi forum (which helped me out a lot):
[[Windows] Relative paths in portable mode](http://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=94181).  
There was one problem: everything had to be done through a batch file,
which may ward off less-experienced users,
and I couldn't find a GUI program that does the same as the batch file.  
So I decided to make a program myself, which does (almost) the same as the batch file in the aforementioned forum thread, and more.

----------

If you're wondering why you need this program or a batch file in the first place to make Kodi portable,
let me explain it to you.  
Out-of-the-box Kodi is already able to be used as a fully-fledged portable media center (provided DirectX
and the Visual C++ Redistributables are installed on every one of them, of course),
but with one flaw: the media sources are static, which can cause problems if you use the same Kodi installation
on multiple computers, because an external hard drive almost never has the same drive letter.  

On one computer your media folder could be located at `D:\Media`.
On another computer this might be `E:\Media`. Or `F:\Media`. And every time this path has to be updated in
Kodi's settings, and every time all media has to be re-added.
Nobody wants to have to do that the whole time, right? Which is where this program comes in.

Before your media folder would be located here:  
Computer 1: `D:\Media`
Computer 2: `E:\Media`
Computer 3: `F:\Media`

After this program does its work, it's still located in those folders, but also in `X:\` (or whichever letter
you choose) on every computer.  
So, essentially, what this program does is mount your media folder as a virtual hard drive, and then launch
Kodi in portable mode, in which you can then (for example) specify `X:\Music`, `X:\TV-series` and `X:\Films`
as your media sources, without ever having to change that again.

## Requirements
- At least Windows Vista; Windows 7 or higher recommended
- Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5.1 (installed by default on most modern Windows installations)
- Kodi (or XBMC)

## Installation
Nothing to install, just a single `.exe` file.
Download from [/releases](https://github.com/nidunc/Portable-launcher-for-Kodi/releases).  
On first launch, the program will ask you for a few things, which it needs to be able to work.
You can change these settings after the first launch through the program's settings
(the gear icon in the top-right - appears after you've finished the initial setup).

## Features
- [x] Launch Kodi in portable mode (with `Kodi.exe -p`)
- [x] Mount user's media folder (using the C# equivalent of `subst.exe`)
- [ ] TO-DO: move Kodi's installation folder to another place (an external hard drive, for example)
if it's installed on the C:\ drive (such as `C:\Program Files (x86)\Kodi` or `C:\Program Files\Kodi`),  
and uninstall Kodi from the computer afterwards (if it was installed to Program Files).
- [ ] TO-DO: move Kodi's application data to the "portable_data" folder in Kodi's installation folder
- [ ] TO-DO: use a different way of storing settings that is portable
- [ ] TO-DO: install/update Kodi automatically
